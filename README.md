# Monkey-Island-Explorer

An explorer/viewer/dumper tool for Monkey Island 1 Special Edition and Monkey Island 2 Special Edition.
It does the following:

* Lets you browse through the game’s files and dump individual files/all files.
* Lets you play and dump the audio (music, speech and sfx).
* Displays the images as you browse and lets you save them as PNG’s or DDS files (for editing)
* Displays the txt, fx and csv text as you browse through the files.
* Together with the Monkey Island Image Converter it forms part of a toolset that enables you to edit the images and put them back into the games (eg to create the much talked about ‘hair patch’).
